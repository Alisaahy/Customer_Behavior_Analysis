# Customer_Behavior_Analysis
This repository contains some customer behavior analysis projects I made.


## Project Overview

This repository consists of 5 main components:

[Cohort Analysis](https://github.com/Alisaahy/Customer_Behavior_Analysis/blob/main/Cohort_analysis.ipynb): A project that observes the customersâ€™ behavior depending on the time they started using the our products to identify churn trend and gain insights in specific user behavior.

[Coversion Rate Analysis](https://github.com/Alisaahy/Customer_Behavior_Analysis/blob/main/Conversion_rate.ipynb): A project that analyzes conversion rate trend in different customer segmentation and predicts conversion rate based on a machine learning model, and come up with ideas to improve revenue.

[Customer Segmentation Analysis](https://github.com/Alisaahy/Customer_Behavior_Analysis/blob/main/Customer_segmentation_analysis.ipynb): Build customer segmentation using both RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis and K-Means Analyais, visualization clusters and identify the specific characteristic and needs for different groups of customers.

[Funnel Analysis](https://github.com/Alisaahy/Customer_Behavior_Analysis/blob/main/Funnel_analysis.ipynb): The project performs funnel analysis for an e-commerce website. Typically, websites have a clear path to conversion: for instance, you land on the home page, then you search, select a product, and buy it. At each of these steps, some users will drop off and leave the site. The sequence of pages that lead to conversion is called 'funnel'. Funnel analysis allows us to understand where/when our users abandon the website. It gives crucial insights on user behavior and on ways to improve the user experience. 

[Marketing Email Campaign Analysis](https://github.com/Alisaahy/Customer_Behavior_Analysis/blob/main/Marketing_email_campaign.ipynb): This project analyzes previous email campaign performace in different segmentations. Understand the factors affect the response rate of marketing email. Gain insights about which email style and length should be used in future email campaign.

[Subscription Analysis](https://github.com/Alisaahy/Customer_Behavior_Analysis/blob/main/Subscription_analysis.ipynb): This project analyzed subscription rate trend for users in each subscription plan. Understand the factors affect user's subscription and churn. Gain insights in specific user behavior in different subscription cycle
